# Mermaid Markdown Features

**Notice:** This extension is bundled with Visual Studio Code. It can be disabled but not uninstalled.

Adds [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org) diagram rendering to built-in chat and Markdown previews.

## Building the webviews

Run `npm run build-webview` from this directory to build the webview bundles.
The Markdown preview uses minified ES modules with code splitting so Mermaid's diagram implementations and add-ons can load on demand.
When copying or packaging the extension, include all emitted files in `markdown-preview-out`: the entry module load sibling chunks using relative URLs.
